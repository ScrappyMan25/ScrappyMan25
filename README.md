### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm 22 Years! Indian! I'm a Computer Games Technology Student at Manchester Metropoilitan University, Manchester :man_student: ! 

### Me as a Programmer
When it comes to Programming I'm someone that aspires to be a good programmer than be good at programming in some language. My approch to programming has always been guided by this notion.

I tend to believe that irrespective of the language - the logic always remains the same - what changes is syntax and implementation. I also think each language has it's place
and its more important to learn and understand where a certain language choice offers an advantage over another. 

This has led me to chase a modular problem solving approch which results in smaller problems with reusable code. This also makes translating pseudoCode to Code a lot easier.

That being said - Languages I'm currently comfortable working with are C#; Lua; Java; JavaScript; Python; GDScript; Php; GoLang; And I'm currently working on my skills in C++. 

I love gaming and now enjoy making games! 

I'm slowly working on uploading my work onto GitHub so hopefully you can have a look around and tell me what you think!
